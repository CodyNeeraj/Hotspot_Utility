# Hotspot Utility
A small but **effective** utility program written by me in **[Java<sup>TM</sup>](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)** Especially for  **Microsoft Windows**<sup>**TM**</sup>  !

#### Overview
This Software is a powerful program which is making it easier to configure wireless-hostpot with a simplistic user Interface.
It will help you in many ways for real world demonstrations like:
 - Configuring Hotspot
 - Active IP Spoofing
 - Manual remote DNS (for local Network only)
 - Many more research methods !
